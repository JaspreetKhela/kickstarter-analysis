# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the outcomes of theater Kickstarter campaigns based on the months in which they were launched and the percentage of successful, failed, and cancelled theater play Kickstarter campaigns based on their respective funding goals. Broadly speaking, this analysis was intended to shed light on how the launch month of the campaign and how the size of the campaign's funding goal would impact the success of the campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This analysis was conducted by:
* Separating the "category" and "subcategory" values into separate columns,
* Converting Unix timestamps into legible dates stored in the "date_created_conversion" and "date_ended_conversion" columns,
* Extracting the years from the legible date columns,
* Creating a Pivot Table in a new sheet titled "theater_outcomes_by_launch_date" by using the "outcomes" as columns, "date_created_conversion" as rows, count of "outcomes" as values, and the "category" and "years" filters; the rows were grouped by month, and
* Creating a PivotChart - line chart with markers - from the PivotTable.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This analysis was conducted by:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
